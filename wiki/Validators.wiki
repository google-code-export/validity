#summary A Summary of validity's validator functions and their usage.

= Introduction =

As we've seen in the GettingStarted page, we can call validator methods on jQuery objects and can also chain those methods in order of importance.

Now we will explore each of the methods in greater detail.

== .require( [message] ) ==

===Arguments===
  * `message`: An optional message to display if an element fails.

This is the most basic validation method. It merely checks to ensure that inputs have values. If any do not have a value (i.e. `value.length` is zero) an error is raised for that input and the form will not be submitted.

===Examples===
{
// Require all inputs, with default error messages.
$("input[type='text']").require();
}
{
// A specific error message is attached to a specific input.
$("#ssn").require("Your Social Sequrity Number is required to proceed.");
}
