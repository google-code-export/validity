Validity was conceived with two main goals in mind:

  # Unobtrusive: Little to no markup requirements, easily setup
  # Customizable: Does not lock you into a look and feel, you get full control over how errors should show up.

The first goal is accomplished by the core of the validity codebase: the validation logic, which is capable of naturally handling complex validation scenarios and halting form submission. However, the system of error messages built on top of that foundation offers you complete customizability.

First of all, you are encouraged to modify the CSS template that ships with validity, you can also select from any of the three built-in output modes: 'label', 'modal' and 'summary'. Furthermore, if these options are insuffiucient for you to customize the error messages, you can write your own output mode as a plugin to validity.

== Editing the CSS ==
When you use validity, you are encouraged to copy the relevant styles from the packaged CSS file and tailor the included styles to your site. Below are summarized the roles of the different styles.

=== Styles used in the 'label' output mode ===
==== 'label.error' ====
Applied to HTML label elements under the 'error' class. These elements are placed immediately after an offending input.

=== Styles used in the 'modal' output mode ===
==== '.validity-modal-msg' ====
Applied to the modal error messages that are positioned near offending inputs. This style should contain the 'position:absolute;' assignment in order for it to be positioned correctly.

==== '.validity-modal-msg:hover' ====
Applied to modal error messages when the cursor hover over them. The style should change to indicate to the user that it can be clicked on (only meaningful if the 'modalErrorsClickable' property is set to true).

=== Styles used in the 'summary' output mode ===
